 🌦️ **Weather App - React**

A simple weather application built with React that provides real-time weather updates for any city using the OpenWeatherMap API.

---

🚀 **How It Works:**

* User inputs a city name to get the current weather data.
* The app makes an API request to OpenWeatherMap to fetch weather information, including temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.
* The data is displayed dynamically with a clean, responsive UI.

---

 🔗 **API Integration:**

* The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API for fetching weather data.
* The API key is securely stored in a `.env` file and accessed using `process.env`.
* Axios or Fetch API is used to make the HTTP requests.

---

 📦 **Technologies Used:**

* **React.js** for building the user interface.
* **Axios/Fetch API** for making API requests.
* **CSS/Styled Components/Tailwind** for styling.
* **Environment Variables** for API key management.
